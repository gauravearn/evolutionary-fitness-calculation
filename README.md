# evolutionary_fitness_calculation
A data structure approach to generate a random  sequence from the polyATGC stretches for evolutionary fitnes. Given a stretch of homopolymers*2 generate a sequence where under the evolutionary fitness if the selection pressure  would have acted accordingly without slip strand mutation.
